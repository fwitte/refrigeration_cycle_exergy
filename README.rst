Exergy Analysis of a Refrigeration Cycle in TESPy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example for the exergy analysis in `TESPy <https://github.com/oemof/tespy>`_.
Find more information about the exergy analysis feature in the respective
`online documentation <https://tespy.readthedocs.io/>`_.

The refrigeration cycle model has the following topology:

    :alt: Topology of the refrigeration cycle

Usage
-----
Clone the repository and build a new python environment. From the base
directory of the repository run

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r ./requirements.txt

to install the version requirements for the refrigeration.py python script.

The original data of the plant are obtained from the following publication:
